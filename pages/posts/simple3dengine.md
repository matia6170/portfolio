This project was heavily inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxMYroGay8c&list=LL&index=8&t=468s) I walked across on YouTube. It walked through step-by-step how a simple 3D engine could be written. I was surprised to see how little math was required to create such a convincing illusion of 3D. It required no linear algebra or matrices. Only some trigonometric functions.
