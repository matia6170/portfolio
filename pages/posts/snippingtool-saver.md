At college, I usually use my gaming laptop connected to two monitors like a desktop with Windows 11. 
While I was away from college at home during this Winter, I was using my Windows 10 ThinkPad to do some STM32 development.
This is when I noticed that Windows 10 would not save my screenshots taken by the snipping tool(Win + Shift + S) to Pictures/Screenshots automatically like Windows 11.
I wrote a Visual Basic Script to do the task for me.


Make sure to find the correct source directory first where Windows stores your screenshots temporarily.

The code can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/matia6170/Snipping-Tool-Auto-Saver).

' Create an array to store two files since taking a screenshot generates two files.
' One high res and one low res

' Clear Folder Initially
